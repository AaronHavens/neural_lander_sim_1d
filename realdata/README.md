# Real data
This folder includes real data to learn the aerodynamic ground effect model $f_a(x,u)$ from the "[Neural-Lander](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08027)" paper, ICRA 2019

`learning_fa.ipynb` includes data preprocessing, training, and data visualization. Two trained models are provided: `Fa_net_12_3_full_Lip16.pth` (with SN) and `Fa_net_12_3_full_Lip79.pth` (without SN).
